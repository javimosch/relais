#!/bin/sh
# Build the RELEASE artifact — a different binary from ./build.sh.
#
# build.sh links against whatever the build host has: libssl, libcrypto,
# libsqlite3 and glibc. machin links those into every binary unless you pass
# --static, so a binary built that way carries a glibc floor and will not start
# on Debian 11, Ubuntu 20.04, RHEL 8, Alpine, or a slim container.
#
# Until now relais published no binary at all: the only documented way in was
# ./build.sh, which needs the machin toolchain. That is a real barrier for
# anyone who just wants to self-host — see the estate-wide install audit
# (https://github.com/javimosch/stranger).
